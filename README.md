# Shield Rebalance

The concept is to trigger OSP if you have no barrier and:
- You have any% shields
- You have >90% health and no shields

## Changelog
- v0.3.0 Health OSP works. Report issues/give feedback on Github!
- v0.2.0 Shield OSP works.
- v0.1.4 Rewrite the mod to use CIL and delegates. Partially working logic.
- v0.1.3 Broken, never released.
- v0.1.2 Reworked the system for checking if you have shields. Now checks if you had shields at the start of the update like it should.
- v0.1.1 A shot in the dark for working logic. I figured out crits are wonky so it doesn't trigger correctly.
- v0.1.0 Initial release, main feature not implemented.
